# Sales Analysis and Profitability Prediction

This project aims to analyze sales performance and predict profitability based on a dataset containing sales order information. The dataset includes columns such as "Order ID," "Order Date," "Ship Date," "Sales," "Quantity," and "Profit," among others.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of sales order information and relevant metrics. It provides insights into the company's sales performance, including sales amounts, profit margins, quantities sold, and other relevant factors. The dataset is organized in a structured format and can be accessed in a CSV or Excel file.

## Objectives

- Analyze Sales Performance:
  - Examine overall sales and profit.
  - Identify sales and profit trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
  - Determine top-performing product categories and sub-categories.
  - Investigate the impact of factors such as ship mode and discounts on sales and profitability.
  - Identify any seasonality or trends based on order dates.

- Predict Profitability:
  - Explore the relationship between quantity and profitability.
  - Investigate the impact of discounting on profitability.
  - Analyze profitability across different customer segments.
  - Identify outliers or anomalies in terms of profitability.

## Approach

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
   - Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., dates to datetime format).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Perform descriptive analysis to gain insights into sales performance and profitability.
   - Visualize data using charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns.



## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance and profitability prediction based on the provided dataset. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, it offers insights into trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales and profitability. The project aims to assist in decision-making processes, such as pricing strategies, inventory management, targeted marketing campaigns, and customer segmentation, to improve overall business performance.
